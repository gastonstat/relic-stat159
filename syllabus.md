### Description

__Statistics 159__ is a course designed to cover philosophy, software tools, 
processes and best practices for reproducible computational research.

Prerequisites: Statistics 133, Statistics 134, and Statistics 135 (or equivalent)


### Course cornerstones:

- __Reproducibility:__ The ability to re-create a past analysis, which is 
crucial for good science.
- __Automation:__ The ability to rapidly re-create an analysis when data
and/or input changes (as it always does).
- __Communication:__ The ability to clearly present, share, and communicate 
your work to others.


### Format

This course will focus heavily on in-class participation in addition to 
assigned readings from scholarly journals, presentations from guest speakers, 
several "feedback" assignments, and weekly blog articles in addition to 
regular practice with the software tools listed in the description.

Your persistent cooperation in group work and contributions to the course 
will culminate into a collaborative term project. The format will be interactive 
and will involve your questions, opinions, and participation.



### Homework Assignments

- Weekly homework assignments are due as posted online.
- Assignments must be turned in during lab discussion.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- After the due date of each assignment, we will discuss the solutions during class.
- No late assignments will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not limited to, theft, extraordinary circumnstances, and your pet's dietary idiosyncrasies.
- Instead of late HW, I will drop your lowest two HW scores.


### Grading Structure

- 10% attendance
- 10% pop quizzes (during lab discussions)
- 20% homework
- 30% midterm
- 30% final


### Advice for success

Try to solve all exercises in each chapter: Some show up on exams. Read all homework and exam questions carefully, and take them literally—don't try to second-guess what is meant. Attend lab discussions.


### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Email sent for any other reason will NOT be considered or acknowledge.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Academic Honesty

Do your own work. Collaborating on homework is fine—but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct).
