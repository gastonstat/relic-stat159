(by Karl Broman)


Remember the fiasco of Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart?
One of their issues was the use of excel to handle their data and some of 
the computations. As much as you should avoid spreadsheet software, 
a lot of people will still use it to store data, and as their main analytical tool.
So it is better to be prepared for those cases, and seriously take into account
Karl Broman's guidelines.
