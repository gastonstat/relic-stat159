### Assigned Reading

<a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-newspaper-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> WaveLab and Reproducible Research</a> (by Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho)

- Skip sections 4 and 5
- Who are the authors? Find out a little bit about the authors
- What is the thesis (i.e. the main point or argument)?
- What is the biased (if any) of the article?
- What are the conclusions?
- What is the part or section that interested you the most?


### Claerbout's famous statement

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication 
> is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. 
> The actual scholarship is the complete software development and 
> the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.


### Donald Knuth's Literate Programming

<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf" target="_blank">
Literate Programming</a> (by Donald Knuth)

> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation 
> of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs
> to be works of literature.

> Let us change the traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
> let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.


### Documentation

- Documentation is key
- Start documenting from the beginning (don't wait till mid or end of project)
- Every data project requires documentation, and reporting
- So you should write documents and narratives about the analysis process
- Reproducibility requires special "authoring" tools and syntax
- Reproducibility is reduced with WYSIWYG products (Word, Google docs, Pages, etc)
- Instead, it is better to use a plain-text solution (WYSIWYM)
- You will have to switch to a markup language
	+ html: markup language of the web
	+ latex: markup language for scientific writing
	+ markdown: lightweight-minimalist solution
- Markdown and pandoc are good starting points
- We' will also cover Rmarkdown and LaTeX but we'll do that later in the course
- [Markdown Philosophy](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)
- Philosophy of Pandoc
- Small demos:
	+ from markdown to html
	+ from markdown to latex
	+ from markdown to pdf
	+ from markdown to docx
	+ etc


### Introduction to Markdown

- About markup languages
- Why do we need to use a markup language (and a text editor)?
- What is the issue with word processors?
- What is Markdown?
- Markdown [philosophy](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)
- Work with markdown online editors
- .Rmd files in R
