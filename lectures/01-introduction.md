- Main cornerstones of the course: __ROC__
	+ Reproducibility
	+ Open (Data) Science
	+ Collaboration
- We'll consider two reproducibility avenues:
	- rerun your own analysis
	- rerun your team analysis
- In class activity (work in pairs):
	- Open google drive
	- Create a google sheet with two variables (X, Y)
	- Make a scatterplot
		+ add title, axis labels, color of points
	- Create a google doc
	- Add a summary of values (min, max, median, mean, sd)
	- Include plot in doc
	- Generate pdf of doc
	- Write down ALL the steps to achieve this task 
	- How many clicks?
	- How many copy-paste?
	- How many minor adjustments?
	- Now add two more values to the data set
	- And update your document (i.e. update the summary and figure)

- Problems around reproducing your own work:
	- Ignorance
	- You don't document what you do
	- You may or may not track changes
	- You may never stop thinking about organization
	- Nobody teaches you these things
	- No one else cares enough about it
	- You may feel copy-paste is tedious and cumbersome (but that's ok, right?)
	- Almost never think about sharing your stuff
	- Things that never crossed your mind
	- ...
	- As you're working on a project, your memory is fresh
	- But then (6 months later) you try to redo your analysis
	- Will you be able to do it reliably?
	- Will you be able to do it in a short period of time?
- Problems around scientific RR:
	- publish or perish
	- publication is the ultimate goal
	- competing for publishing
	- no time (we're all busy)
	- reviewers don't have time to read code and run commands
	- don't know how to do it
	- no one will understand my code
	- grad students come and go
	- scientists move to new institutions
	- a lab cannot reproduce its results
	- things are not well organized (where is that file?, who wrote what?)
	- technology becomes obsolete
	- obstacles to sharing
	- concerns about privacy, condifentiality, copyright, commercial,
	Intellectual Property, patents, etc
- Overall problems and costs:
	- no established standards
	- lack of incentives
	- fear of sharing, fear of getting scooped
	- these things are just for programmers
	- there's still many locks in various fields
	- "Reproducibility" is a large and vague adjective
	- it takes time
	- it requires new mindset
	- it requires discipline
	- many tools to learn
	- it can be overwhelming without help (or time)
	- it's easier said than done


There's light at the end of the tunnel

- Benefits:
	- Reduce errors (avoid self-embarrasement)
	- Increase efficiency (in the long-run)
	- Increase productivity (in the long-run)
	- High ROI (in the long run)
	- Facilitate collaboration
	- Received more citations and recognition
	- Coding is a lot of work, and you should let it see the screen-light

- In this course:
	- we'll discuss how to solve some of these problems
	- we'll learn various computational tools to improve our workflow
	- we'll talk about good practices
