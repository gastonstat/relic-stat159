### Assigned Reading

<a href="http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-newspaper-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Introduction of the Reproducibility Guide </a> (by rOpenSci)

- Why do reproducible research?
- What are the principles of Reproducible Research?
- What are the different kinds of reproducible research?
- What is the most striking part of the guide?
- What part is the most obscure or hard part to understand?
- Is there anything in the reading that resonates with your experience?
- What would be the _take home message(s)_?


### Discussion

- So what is "Reproducibility"?
- Terminology and debate
- There's not a unique terminology
- Types of reproducibility
- Focus of this course


### Activity

- Form groups of 4 people
- I'll give you descriptions of 5 options
- How would you sort those options on a spectrum?
- What's better: to share code or to share data?
- If you had to choose one (share code or share data), which one would you choose? Why?
- How would you share it?

### Documentation

- Documentation is key
- Every data project requires documentation, and reporting
 (i.e. writing documents and narratives about the analysis process)
- Start documenting from the beginning (don't wait till mid or end of project)
- Reproducibility requires special "authoring" tools and standard syntax
- Reproducibility is reduced with WYSIWYG products (Word, Google docs, Pages, etc)
- Instead, it is better to use a plain-text solution (WYSIWYM)
- You will have to switch to a markup language
	+ __html:__ markup language of the web
	+ __latex:__ markup language for scientific writing
	+ __markdown:__ lightweight-minimalist solution
- Markdown and pandoc are good starting points
- We' will also cover Rmarkdown and LaTeX but we'll do that later in the course


### Introduction to Markdown

- About markup languages
- Why do we need to use a markup language (and a text editor)?
- What is the issue with word processors?


#### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by 
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) and Aaron Swartz allowing people 
"to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert 
it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)". 

- More [technical details about Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Markdown [philosophy](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)
- Small demos:
	+ from markdown to html
	+ from markdown to latex
	+ from markdown to pdf
	+ from markdown to docx
	+ etc
- Work with markdown online editors
- Let's check some basics with [markdown live preview](http://markdownlivepreview.com/) 
- .Rmd files in R
