  Basics of Makefiles
</p>

Installation for Windows users:

- Make for Windows: [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- Download the Setup program: [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- After installing Make, check if it works. Open the command line and type:
`make --version`

About Make

- __Automation:__ The ability to rapidly re-create an analysis when data
and/or input changes (as it always does).
- Scripts to automate things
- What is GNU Make?
- We won't really use Make for compiling, but for automating tasks
- The main advantage is its capability to track timestamps
- It only executes things that have changed
- I've found that the learning curve is a bit steep
- We'll keep working with Make throughout the course,
so we will start with very simple makefiles
