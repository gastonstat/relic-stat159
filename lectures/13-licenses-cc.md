### Collaborating with Github


#### Collaborators: Full read and write access

- How to add a collaborator?
- Collaborators must have a github account
- Full access: read and write access to collaborators
- Key concept: Good Communication is critical
- Doing Commit Reviews (peer review):
	+ Adding comments to commits
- Use of _issues_
	+ Browsing issues
	+ Milestones
	+ Labels for issues
	+ Creating new labels
	+ Openning and closing issues
	+ Issues cannot be deleted!
- Workflow:
	+ Create a branch
	+ Make changes
	+ Push branch
	+ Submit a pull request


#### Centralized workflow

Collaborating with forked repositories

- You don't give full read-write access to collaborators
- Working with forked repositories
- Pull requests
