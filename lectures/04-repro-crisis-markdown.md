### Documentation

- Documentation is key
- Start documenting from the beginning (don't wait till mid or end of project)
- Every data project requires documentation, and reporting
- So you should write documents and narratives about the analysis process
- Reproducibility requires special "authoring" tools and syntax
- Reproducibility is reduced with WYSIWYG products (Word, Google docs, Pages, etc)
- Instead, it is better to use a plain-text solution (WYSIWYM)
- You will have to switch to a markup language
	+ html: markup language of the web
	+ latex: markup language for scientific writing
	+ markdown: lightweight-minimalist solution
- Markdown and pandoc are good starting points
- We will also cover latex but we'll do that later in the course
- Philosophy of Markdown
- Philosophy of Pandoc
- Small demos:
	+ from markdown to html
	+ from markdown to latex
	+ from markdown to pdf
	+ from markdown to docx
	+ etc
