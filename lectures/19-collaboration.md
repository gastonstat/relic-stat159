> Cross-disciplinary collaborations have become an increasingly important part 
> of science ... On the one hand, for scientists working in theoretical fields such 
> as computer science, mathematics, or statistics, validation of predictions against 
> experimental data is of the utmost importance. On the other hand, experimentalists, 
> such as molecular biologists, geneticists, or clinicians, often want to reduce the 
> number of experiments needed to achieve a certain scientific aim, to obtain insight 
> into processes that are inaccessible using current experimental techniques, or to 
> handle large volumes of data, which are far beyond any human analysis skills ...
> Initiating and successfully maintaining cross-disciplinary collaborations can be 
> challenging but highly rewarding.

- Rule 3: Different Fields Have Different Terminologies: Learn the Language
- Rule 4: Different Fields Move at Different Speeds: Do not Become Impatient
- Rule 5: Different Fields Have Different Reward Models: Know What You Can Expect
- Rule 6: What Different Fields Mean by "Data"
- Rule 7: Assess the Advantages and Disadvantages of Service Work
- Rule 8: Create and Manage Structural Bonds
- Rule 9: Recognise When Things Are Not Working Well
- Rule 10: Be Synergistic
