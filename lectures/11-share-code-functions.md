### Coding Functions

- Often, you will need to encapsulate some of your code and create functions
- Advatanges of writing functions
	+ Avoid DRY
	+ Enable Reusability
	+ Facilitate Extensibility
	+ Force you to better think
- How to write functions?
	+ start small
	+ make sure your code works
	+ don't worry initially about optimization
	+ encapsulate your code
	+ think about the users
	+ think about special cases
- Good practices for writing functions
	+ Modularize
	+ Prefer simple functions
	+ Choose a naming style (descriptive)
	+ Be consistent
	+ Argument names
	+ Length (lines of code)
- Profiling
	+ Efficiency
	+ Debugging
