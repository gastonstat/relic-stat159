### Claerbout's famous statement

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication 
> is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. 
> The actual scholarship is the complete software development and 
> the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.


### Donald Knuth's Literate Programming

Literate Programming</a> (by Donald Knuth)

> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation 
> of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs
> to be works of literature.

> Let us change the traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
> let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.


### Pandoc

- Recap: Reproducibility requires special "authoring" tools and markup syntaxes
- Markdown and pandoc are good starting points
- Philosophy of Pandoc
- Small demos:
	+ from markdown to html
	+ from markdown to latex
	+ from markdown to pdf
	+ from markdown to docx
	+ etc

Pandoc is a command-line tool. There is no graphic user interface. 
So, to use it, youâ€™ll need to open a terminal window.

To verify that pandoc is installed, type:

```bash
pandoc --version
```

By default, input is interpreted as pandoc markdown, and output is HTML 4.
Assuming that you have a text file `doc.md` written in markdown,
the default command to generate the html file would be:
```bash
pandoc doc.md
``` 

The previous command can be equivalently executed with the options
`-f` _from_ markdown, and `-t` _to_ html: 
```bash
pandoc -f html -t markdown doc.md
```

Converting _from_ HTML _to_ markdown: 
```bash
pandoc -f html -t markdown
```
