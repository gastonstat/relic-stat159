### Claerbout's famous statement

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication 
> is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. 
> The actual scholarship is the complete software development and 
> the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.

Literate Programming</a> (by Donald Knuth)

> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation 
> of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs
> to be works of literature.

> Let us change the traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, 
> let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
